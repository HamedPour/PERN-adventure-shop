# Adventure Shop (PERN)

## [Live Preview](https://adventure-shop.herokuapp.com/)

This is a full stack application created from the ground up using:

- React
- Redux
- Node (Express)
- Postgresql
- Paypal Dev Api

The application also utilises _JWT authentication_, _bcrypt password hashing_, and server/client side _route guarding_ among many other packages. I learned a lot about authentication and authorisation researching these technologies.

The payment gateway is handled by Paypal and setup to use Paypal's sandbox api. I did find the Paypal Dev Api cumbersome to use and will probably opt to use a different payment service in my next project.

This app was an absolute pleasure to build.
